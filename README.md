**Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard**

This project is an interactive web-based dashboard that visualizes the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbial species found in human navels. Built using HTML, JavaScript, D3.js, and Plotly.js, the dashboard enables users to explore the dataset by selecting specific test subjects and viewing related visualizations. The key features include a demographic information panel that dynamically displays metadata for the selected sample, a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 10 microbial species for each individual, and a bubble chart illustrating the distribution of microbial cultures. The app fetches data from a JSON endpoint, processes it using D3.js, and dynamically updates charts and information panels based on user interactions. This project demonstrates the integration of data visualization and interactivity in a user-friendly dashboard format. It is deployed on GitHub Pages, providing an accessible platform to explore the rich diversity of microbial life found in the human body.
